                    </div>


                    <div class="letter-body">
                        <p>Merry Christmas my love 🤍</p>
                        <p>(go ahead and click the music button if you haven't already :))</p>
                        <p>I’ve been thinking about you so much, and I wanted to write you something that is real. Not
                            just a cute message, not just a “merry christmas baby” text, but something that actually
                            holds how I feel about you.</p>
                        <p>I love you. I know I say that every day and all the time, but I don’t know if I can tell you
                            or show you how much I love you, but I’ll try.</p>
                        <p>I love you from the heart. I love you in a way that makes me feel calm and scared at the same
                            time, because you matter to me so much that I don’t even know how to act normal about it
                            sometimes. You are genuinely my favorite person. Being with you feels like the first time in
                            my life that love feels real, not like something I have to earn or fight for.</p>
                        <p>And I want to say this first because you deserve to hear it clearly. I see you. I see how
                            much you carry. I see how hard you work. I see how much pressure you put on yourself. I see
                            how you always want to have a plan and a schedule, and how being late stresses you out, and
                            how you always try to stay on top of everything. I see how independent you are, and how you
                            handle so much on your own even when you are tired. I see how you beat yourself up when you
                            feel like you messed up or didn’t do enough. I see all of it.</p>
                        <p>And baby, I am so proud of you. I’m proud of your internship at the library. I’m proud of you
                            being Elections Director. I’m proud of how seriously you take your responsibilities. I’m
                            proud of how much you care, because you really do care so much. You show up. You try. You
                            lead. You give so much of yourself and you still keep going, even when you’re stressed.
                            You’re honestly amazing, and I need you to know that you are doing a great job. Like
                            genuinely. Even on the days you feel like you aren’t.</p>
                        <p>I also know that sometimes you carry yourself like you have to be strong all the time. Like
                            you have to have it together. Like you have to handle everything. And I know a lot of that
                            comes from you being the oldest, and having to grow up being responsible and tough, and
                            always being the one who can’t fall apart because you have so much on you. But with me, I
                            don’t want you to feel like you have to be strong. With me, I want you to be able to
                            breathe. With me, I want you to be able to rest. With me, I want you to feel like you can
                            just be a person, not the one who holds everything together.</p>
                        <p>I want to be your peace, not another thing you have to manage.</p>
                        <p>And I want to be honest with you too. I know I’m not perfect in the way I love you. I know
                            sometimes I drop the ball in treating you in the way that matters to you. I know sometimes I
                            come on too strong. I ask too many questions. I get anxious. I overthink. I apologize too
                            much. I want reassurance. I want to feel like we are okay. I want to feel like I’m not
                            losing you. And I know that can be tiring sometimes, especially when you already have a lot
                            going on.</p>
                        <p>But I want you to know it comes from how much I love you, not from me trying to control you
                            or pressure you. It comes from a place in me that is scared because for most of my life,
                            love felt conditional. Not just from my parents, but even with friends too. I always felt
                            like I had to be a certain way to be accepted. I would sacrifice parts of myself just to
                            feel wanted. There were times I felt alone even when I wasn’t technically alone. I would sit
                            at lunch tables feeling like I didn’t really belong. Even when I had people around, I didn’t
                            feel loved in that deep way.</p>
                        <p>And then you came into my life.</p>
                        <p>And Diya, you accept me. You choose me. You love me even when I’m not perfect. You see me,
                            and you still want me. And that is something I don’t take lightly. It scares me sometimes
                            because a part of me still worries that one day you’re going to realize there’s always
                            better, and that I’m not enough. I worry you’ll wake up and think I’m not all that. I’m not
                            in perfect shape. I’m not the most attractive guy in the world. I get upset sometimes. I get
                            emotional. I get attached.</p>
                        <p>But the truth is, you are worth it to me. You are worth all the growing I need to do. You are
                            worth me learning how to love you better. You are worth me learning how to be steady, calm,
                            patient, and emotionally safe for you. I don’t want my love to feel heavy. I don’t want it
                            to feel like pressure. I want it to feel like comfort. I want you to feel safe with me, and
                            I want you to feel like you can come to me without having to prepare yourself first.</p>
                        <p>And I want to say this too. I know I’ve wanted you to be more open with me. I’ve wanted you
                            to be vulnerable with me. I’ve wanted to know you on a deeper level. Not because I want to
                            invade your world, but because I want to feel close to you. I want to feel like we are
                            connected in that special way where we really know each other. But I’m also realizing that
                            closeness is not something I can force. It’s something I have to earn. It’s something that
                            comes when you feel safe, when you feel respected, when you feel like I’m not going to make
                            you feel pressured to talk.</p>
                        <p>So I want you to know I’m trying. I’m trying to be better at giving you space when you need
                            it. I’m trying to be better at not taking it personally when you’re tired. I’m trying to be
                            better at being calm and steady instead of intense. I’m trying to love you in a way that
                            actually lands for you.</p>
                        <p>Because I want us. Not just in the moment. I want us long term. I want us to be a team. I
                            want to be your partner for real. I want to be the person you can depend on, and I want to
                            build something with you that feels consistent and safe and strong. Like life partners. Like
                            we’ve got each other no matter what.</p>
                        <p>And baby, with your LSAT coming up, and everything you have going on, I want you to know I am
                            on your side completely. I want to support you in the ways that actually help. If you need
                            quiet, I’ll give you quiet. If you need help with something, I’ll do it. If you need a
                            break, I’ll be your break. If you need to vent, I’ll listen. If you need to cry, I’ll hold
                            you. You are not a burden to me. Your feelings are not too much for me. I actually love when
                            you let me in, because it makes me feel closer to you. It makes me feel like I’m really with
                            you.</p>
                        <p>And I want to keep learning how to show up for you better. I want to be on time. I want to
                            have a plan. I want to make things easier for you. I want you to feel like you can lean on
                            me and not feel guilty. I know you’re hyper-independent and stubborn, and I love that about
                            you, but I also want you to know you don’t have to do everything alone with me. Let me help
                            you. Let me take care of you sometimes. You deserve that.</p>
                        <p>I’m sorry that I don’t say what I said earlier enough, but I want you to hear it, and I want
                            you to know that I appreciate you and love you…for you. Not the feeling you make me feel,
                            not just the love for you, but I love YOU! Everything about you, your mind, your eyes,
                            smile, your body (your belly i love heheheh), your goals/ambitions, you family, your
                            beliefs, and so much more.</p>
                        <p>I’m sorry I couldn’t get you anything big physically for Christmas. Money has been a little
                            tight, and I hate that, because you deserve the world. But even though I couldn’t buy you
                            something, I still wanted to make you something. I wanted to give you something that had
                            effort and intention in it. That’s why I made you the website. I really hope you like it,
                            and I hope when you see it you feel loved.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for being in my life, Diya. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for loving me the
                            way you do. You have changed me. You’ve made me want to be better. You’ve made me want to
                            heal parts of myself I didn’t even know were still hurting. You’ve made me believe love can
                            be real and safe.</p>
                        <p>I love you so much. I’m serious about you. I’m proud to be yours. And I’m not going anywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>Merry Christmas baby 🤍</p>
